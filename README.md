Simple frontend for the [substrate TCR](https://github.com/gautamdhameja/substrate-tcr) runtime. This is a react.js app, bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This app interacts with the Substrate TCR runtime using the [Polkadot JS API](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) javascript client library.

The relevant code that interacts with the Substrate node using the Polkadot JS API is in the [tcrService.js](./src/services/tcrService.js) file.

## Usage

1. Run a local Substrate node with [Substrate-TCR](https://github.com/gautamdhameja/substrate-tcr) runtime.
1. Clone this repo.
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`

The UI should automatically connect to the local Substrate node.

**Note**: This UI currently does not support the initialization of the TCR and transfer of tokens. These functions can be called from the Polkadot Apps UI as described [here](https://github.com/gautamdhameja/substrate-tcr/wiki/How-to-test-the-TCR-runtime-using-Polkadot-Apps-Portal#step-1-initialize-the-tcr). Make sure to use the same account seeds in both places.
