# Substrate TCR Frontend

Simple frontend for the [substrate TCR implementation](https://github.com/gautamdhameja/substrate-tcr). This is a react.js app, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This app interacts with the Substrate TCR runtime using the [Polkadot API](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) javascript client library.

**This is a work in progress.**
